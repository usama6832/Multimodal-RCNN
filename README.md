Dataset details:

Full Dataset will be available on request if permission is granted from Hospital.
Medical big data is collected from A-grade central hospital in Wuhan, China.
Experiment is performed on Medical Big Data consisting of both structued and unstructed data.
Structured data is been recorded and preprocess with the help of doctors and hospital experts.   
Unstrutured Data consists of 706 medical records of chronic disease patient, that is confidential, will be availble only on request if permission is granted from the hospital. 

Model was implimented using C++ programming language.
